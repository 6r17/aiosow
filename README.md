## **A**synchronous **I**/**O** **S**oftware **O**rchestration **W**orkstation

`aiosow` is functionnal framework on top of an asynchronous task manager.

> It is meant to allow software architect shape how code should be used.

- **Enforced Separation of Concerns** 

`aiosow` encourage a structure that separate implementations from the behavior.

Defined boundaries for different parts of the codebase makes it easier to reason from buisness perspective.

- **No framework friction & Unparalled modularity**

Implementation have no knoweledge of `aiosow`.

Splitting `implementation` from their usage allows one to completely rewrite how it's different
elements are used, swap them, combine them.

### Example

`implementation.py`
```python

def initialize_memory():
    return { "message": "hello world !" }

def print_message(message):
    print(message)
```

`bindings.py`
```python
setup(initialize_memory)
routine(1)(print_message)
```
