a high-level Python framework that help write and structure low coupled code.

## So what is this ?

Stims is state-machine programmable using decorators. It is meant to help you 
write uncoupled and unopiniated functional code that you can decorate to specify
it's triggering mechanisms.

The idea is that you are writing your implementation just as you would normally,
and use the bindings to specify the events that should trigger it.

The benefit is that you are splitting your business-logic from your implementation.
