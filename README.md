## **A**synchronous **I**/**O** **S**oftware **O**rchestration **W**orkstation

`aiosow` is functionnal framework on top of an asynchronous task manager.

It is meant to allow software architect shape how code should be used.

- **Enforced Separation of Concerns** 

`aiosow` encourage a structure that separate implementations from the behavior.

Defined boundaries for different parts of the codebase, makes it easier to maintain and scale.
`aiosow` provide a set of tools that let developers interconnect and customize multiple features.

- **Unparalled modularity**

Splitting `implementation` from their usage allows one to completely rewrite how it's different
elements are used, swap them, combine them.

- **No framework friction**

Conventions, rules and boundaries should be defined by team's architect or by teams themselves, not
by a tool. `aiosow` also makes sure that implementation have no knowledge of the framework, making
implementation focused on the problem rather than the tools.

- **Code lives with it's problem**

A space dedicated to each buisness problem rather than technical-problems makes it easier to reason
from buisness perspective instead of engineering.
