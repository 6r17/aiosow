"""
`aiohttp` is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for Python.
It provides a client and server API for making HTTP requests and 
handling HTTP responses, supporting features such as HTTP/1.x and HTTP/2,
SSL/TLS encryption, cookies, and WebSockets. 
Aiohttp's server API is built on top of asyncio, allowing it to handle a large 
number of concurrent requests efficiently. It also provides support for routing 
and middleware, allowing developers to easily define complex request handling logic.
